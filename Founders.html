        <h3>Bhante Rathana</h3>
        <p>Since the age of 13, Buddhism has been the heart of my life and practice. I am Bhante Rathana, originally from Sri Lanka, now residing at Serenity Central of New England in Jacksonville, 
           Vermont, where I teach meditation and guide others in spiritual development through the Buddha’s noble teachings.
           Ordained as a novice monk in 1999 and receiving higher ordination in 2008, I mastered Sanskrit and Pali during my early monastic education. I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Buddhist Philosophy from the University of Kelaniya in 2014.
           I moved to the United States in 2016, initially serving at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles until 2021, then spending three years at Bhavana Society in West Virginia. In May 2024, I joined the community here at Serenity Central.
           Guided by loving-kindness and compassion, I am dedicated to sharing the Dhamma and cultivating peace within myself and others. Vermont’s Green Mountains and natural beauty have become a profound source of inspiration in my practice and teaching.</p>
